# BANGLA-FAKE-NEWS-CLASSIFICATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Problem Statement
Nowadays, everything is getting digitalized. So, with the blessings of modern technology, people can read news of the whole world through different kinds of online news portals. A large number of people in our country now read online news portals in Bengali. Among these news portals, there also have some fake news and real news. But, in maximum time mass people can’t discriminate between this two. That’s why it is necessary to classify fake news and real news. In this project, we use different kinds of machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree for the dataset named “BanFakeNews” to classify whether the news is real or fake. Among these models Logistic regressions comparatively performs better gaining 92%.


Dataset
The provided dataset contains around 8.5k news data on the different news portals. Between these, around 7k are authentic, and around 1k are fake news. The fake news is labeled with 0 and the real
